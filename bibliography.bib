  abstract  = "Passively-generated location data have the potential to augment
               mobility and transportation research, as demonstrated by a
               decade of research. A common trait of these data is a high
               proportion of missingness. Na{\"\i}ve handling, including
               list-wise deletion of subjects or days, or linear interpolation
               across time gaps, has the potential to bias summary results. On
               the other hand, it is unfeasible to collect mobility data at
               frequencies high enough to reflect all possible movements. In
               this paper, we describe the relationship between the temporal
               and spatial aspects of these data gaps, and illustrate the
               impact on measures of interest in the field of mobility. We
               propose a method to deal with missing location data that
               combines a so-called top-down ratio segmentation method with
               simple linear interpolation. The linear interpolation imputes
               missing data. The segmentation method transforms the set of
               location points to a series of lines, called segments. The
               method is designed for relatively short gaps, but is evaluated
               also for longer gaps. We study the effect of our imputation
               method for the duration of missing data using a completely
               observed subset of observations from the 2018 Statistics
               Netherlands travel study. We find that long gaps demonstrate
               greater downward bias on travel distance, movement events and
               radius of gyration as compared to shorter but more frequent
               gaps. When the missingness is unrelated to travel behavior,
               total sparsity can reach levels of up to 20\% with gap lengths
               of up to 10 min while maintaining a maximum 5\% downward bias in
               the metrics of interest. Temporal aspects can increase these
               limits; sparsity occurring in the evening or night hours is less
               biasing due to fewer travel behaviors.",

  abstract  = "Moving object data handling has received a fair share of
               attention over recent years in the spatial database community.
               This is understandable as positioning technology is rapidly
               making its way into the consumer market, not only through the
               already ubiquitous cell phone but soon also through small,
               on-board positioning devices in many means of transport and in
               other types of portable equipment. It is thus to be expected
               that all these devices will start to generate an unprecedented
               data stream of time-stamped positions. Sooner or later, such
               enormous volumes of data will lead to storage, transmission,
               computation, and display challenges. Hence, the need for
               compression techniques.",
