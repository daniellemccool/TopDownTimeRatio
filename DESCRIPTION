Title: Top-Down Time Ratio segmentation for coordinate trajectories
Version: 0.1.0

Description: This package applies the compression technique specified in 
    Meratnia and de By (2004) on timestamped coordinate trajectories. This is an
    improvement on the well-known Douglas-Peucker algorithm for segmentation 
    that operates not on the basis of perpendicular distances, but instead
    distances with respect to time.
