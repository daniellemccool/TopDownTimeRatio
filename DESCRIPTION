Description: This package applies the compression technique specified in 
    Meratnia and de By (2004) <doi:10.1007/978-3-540-24741-8> on timestamped
    coordinate trajectories. This is an improvement on the well-known
    Douglas-Peucker algorithm for segmentation that operates not on the basis of
    perpendicular distances, but instead distances with respect to time.
    Provided a trajectory with timestamps, tdtr() returns a set of straight-
    line segments that can represent the full trajectory. McCool, Lugtig,
    and Schouten (2022) <doi:10.1007/s11116-022-10328-2> describe this method as
    implemented here in more detail.
